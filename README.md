# What is Redisoo?

Redisoo pronouces /redisoÍžo/, means **Redis + Through**.

In short, Redisoo makes Redis directly connect to the backend database, 

including Mysql, Postegresql, Oracle, ODBC(SQL Server), SqlLite, DB2, Firbird.

It makes Redis the 'Cache Through' pattern to solve some problems.

# The problems Redisoo solves and the benefits Redisoo brings

## Consistency

In "Cache Aside" pattern, there is an inconsistency problem.

In "Cache Through" pattern, Redisoo solves the inconsistent problem.

## Avoiding duplicated Read/Write to database, especially for peak time

In the above diagram, suppose that application 1 & 2 get the same key from Redis at the same time.

If applications can not find the key in Redis, they both get the value from database then write it to Redis. 

The second read from database is a duplicated one, and it can not be avoided in Cache Aside pattern. 

The same thing could happend with duplicated write to database.  

In peak time, the fan-out number could be hundreds or thousands depending on how many applications you have.

Redisoo can solve the duplicated action problem, 

only **ONE** read/from (or write/to) database needed with thousands application concurrently read or write. 

Yes, there are thousands duplicated read/write to Redis 

but that is why Redis is there as a Cache because we want Redis save the traffic to the backend database.

## Only one applicaton component for read/write to data store

In Cache Aside pattern, you need develop a lot of components for the same logic for different application.

E.g. 

If you have Python/Java/Php/C++ application, you need develop the same logic for all kinds of application.

Even in one language with serveral applicatons, if the abstraction or common library is not good enough, 

you need write different codes for the same logic.

Redisoo can save the code because **NO SQL anymore**.

## NO SQL anymore

This time, Redisoo can save the code because every components only need deal with the basic opertions, 

**Get/Set/Del** to Redis, 

No SELECT/UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE sql statement for any database. 

NO JDBC, NO Python Database module, NO C/C++ database library.

The applications only see the Redis and only code for Redis, no need to code for database. 

Redisoo deals with database for you.
