# What is Redisoo?

Redisoo pronouces /redisoÍžo/, means **Redis + Through**.

In short, Redisoo makes Redis directly connect to the backend database, 

including Mysql, Postegresql, Oracle, ODBC(SQL Server), SqlLite, DB2, Firbird.

It makes Redis the 'Cache Through' pattern to solve some problems.

# The problems Redisoo solve

## Consistency

In "Cache Aside" pattern, there is an inconsistency problem.

In "Cache Through" pattern, Redisoo solves the inconsistent problem.

## Duplicated Action, worst for peak time

In the above diagram, suppose that application 1 & 2 get the same key from Redis at the same time.

If applications can not find the key in Redis, they both get the value from database then write it to Redis. 

The second action is a duplicated one, and it can not be avoided in Cache Aside pattern. 

The Cache Through pattern can solve the duplicated action problem. 

In peak time, the fan-out number may be hundreds or thousands depending on how many applications you have in a system.

## Duplicated applicaton component for read/write to data store

You need develop a lot of components for the same logic for different application.

E.g. 

If you have Python/Java/Php/C++ application, you need develop the same logic for all kinds of application.

Even in one language with serveral applicatons, if the abstraction or common library is not good enough, 

you need write different codes for the same logic.

This time, Cache Through can save the code because every component only need deal with the basic opertions, 

**Get/Set/Del** to Redis, no SQL statement for any database. (So no JDBC, no Python Database module) 

The applications only see the Redis, no database. Redisoo deals with database for you.
